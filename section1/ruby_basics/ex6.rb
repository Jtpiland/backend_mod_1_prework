# 1. comment
# 2. 4 places have a string within a string: twice in line 6 and once each in line 13 & 14
# 3. w + e makes a longer string because the variables are defined with strings in them already.
# 4. Im guessing that "" and '' are interchangeable unless there needs to be a string within in a string.

## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I already think I have a growth mindset and view learning as a process.  I need to focus on keeping in mind that it is a journey and placing value in that. I also need to get better at building in break times because I often tend to want to work through a problem until it is completed, which is not always going to be a possibility. I want to start reading more! Not only school related reading (which won't really be an option) but for entertainment too. I'd also like to put more thought into a sustainable "brain healthy" diet. I think something that could be added is how super learners take notes or deal with all the information they gather from all the reading and how to work on retaining more of it.

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is when data gets put in the middle of a string.
`puts "A #{animal} earns their stripes"`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

gets and gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

.length - Measures the total length, in characters, of a string.
.sub - makes a one time substitution in code. (.gsub is a global sub method that will "replace all")
